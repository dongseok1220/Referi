      "Q: Playing in their second straight Thanksgiving game, the Eagles struggled especially on defense, where they were unable to stop the much-hyped Lions offense. The worst of it all was how unproven rookie Eric Rowe was tasked with covering wide receiver Calvin Johnson, leading to Johnson catching 3 touchdowns. Stafford’s five passing touchdowns, including three of them to Johnson was too much for the Eagles to overcome and for the second consecutive time this season, the Eagles gave up 45 points in a game. With the loss, the Eagles drop to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. How many TD passes did Stafford throw other than to Jhonson?\n",

      "In the quaint community of Midvale, the local school stood as a beacon of enlightenment, nurturing the minds of the next generation. The teachers, the lifeblood of this institution, were tasked with the noble duty of education, while the unsung heroes—the maintenance crew—ensured the smooth functioning of the school's infrastructure. Amidst this, three town residents, Angela, Greg, and Travis, found themselves at a juncture of life where they were presented with the opportunity to serve in one of these crucial roles. The challenge now lay in the hands of the manager, who had to assign them to either teaching or maintenance, a decision that would set the course for their contributions to the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angela was a fiercely independent woman, beset with a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. She was a woman of very few words, often finding it hard to articulate her thoughts and explain things clearly. Venturing into education seemed a maze with her apathetic attitude towards learning. She was also seen to be disinterested in reading and the literary field as a whole. This was a juxtaposition to her inability to contribute to maintenance duties because of her fear of tools and machinery, a sinister remnant of a past accident that still haunted her. The basic handyman skills, which most locals learned growing up, were also absent from her repertoire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angela's interactions with Greg and Travis further complicated the equation. On one hand, Greg and Angela had a habit of arguing constantly over trivial matters, which once culminated in their failure to complete a shared basic training exercise adequately. On the other hand, Angela and Travis simply had nothing in common. Their conversations were often fraught with awkward silences, indicative of their lack of shared interests. This lack of coordination was epitomized during a recent team-building exercise when their team finished last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greg was the blue-collar type with a broad frame and muscular build. He had a work ethic that never shied away from toiling through the day to get things done. Growing up, he often helped his father with simple home repairs and minor renovations, learning the ropes of basic handiwork. Additionally, Greg had fortified his skills while refurbishing an old shed with Travis, a testament to their compatible personalities. However, his dislike for education was well known throughout town, further amplified by his lack of patience, especially with children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travis, the third cog in the wheel, was a man of many peculiarities. His stage fright was almost legendary and made it nearly impossible for him to stand in front of a crowd. Often, the mere thought of it could unnerve him. His physical constitution was lightweight and fragile, and long hours of manual labor made him weary. He also had a revulsion towards dirt that he complained about at every opportune moment. Like the others, studying did not appeal to him much, so much so that he had stopped reading completely after leaving school prematurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manager understood well that a team’s success depends heavily on the contribution and compatibility of each member. He observed, analyzed, and considered. Now, it was up to him to assign roles to Angela, Greg, and Travis. The school needed educators and maintenance staff, and each had to play their part perfectly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, let's look at Greg. Greg has a dislike for education and a lack of patience, so let's assume his skill level for maintenance is 1. However, Greg has helped with home repairs and minor renovations, so let's assume his maintenance skill level is 2.\n",

      "Now, let's look at the relationships and how people work together.\n",

My crew is a trio of unique individuals - Alice, Bob, and Charlie, each possessing distinct talents and inclinations. My role involves the strategic distribution of key tasks, specifically navigating our spacecraft and spearheading scientific research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bob, in many ways, is a gem within our crew, hailing from a background of dextrous decisions and astrophysical expertise. His references include commendations for understanding high-risk, high-pressure situations and reacting accordingly. Bob excels at thoroughly considering options before rashly diving into tasks, a gentle nod at Alice's keenness for quick solutions. His competency extends to advanced flight simulations, metaphorically carving a path further into the stars from the comfort of his own home. Amidst the high-stress situation of our mission, Bob finds solace in Charlie's laid-back humor, laughter echoing in the narrow corridors of our spacecraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlie concurrently admires Bob's unerring commitment to method and calm. While he may struggle with multitasking while being swamped at the console, he enjoys working in tandem with Bob. Charlie's trepidation towards complex controls and potential navigation mishaps aren't entirely unfounded; an unexpected rendezvous with a satellite from past experiences had everyone holding their breath. Although lacking in-depth theoretical understanding of some advanced concepts, Charlie has nonetheless ventured with lead researchers on multiple occasions before our mission. He adds that Alice's impatience doesn’t do justice to his meticulousness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Alice is our team's high-energy dynamo, never seeming to run out of fuel. Her physical experience is commendable, although she may find herself tangled in theoretical complexities far too often. During the simulation drills, Alice's attempt at navigating the spaceship left a lot more to be desired. The cascade of controls and buttons on our shuttle daunts her, causing her to lean on her crewmates for support through difficult tasks and data interpretation. She often finds herself at odds with Bob's methodical approach, her quick-paced nature clashing against Bob's slow burn.\n",

      "As the morning sun bathed the bustling software company's headquarters in a warm glow, I reclined in my chair, surveying the room filled with skilled individuals. Today's mission was straightforward yet demanding - data migration and project coordination. The task fell upon the capable shoulders of Allison, Sophia, and Mark, a triumvirate of talent, each with their unique strengths. Yet, their synergy was not as seamless as I would have desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "First was Allison, our resident hard-worker. No challenge seemed too daunting for her; the woman was a powerhouse who could crank out codes as efficiently as a poet could write sonnets. Unlike many of her peers, she always met her project deadlines. That discipline was a virtue many sought advice on, her organized flair was infectious to the team. Yet, beneath the calm exterior of this punctual queen, the storm had started to brew after a frequent dismissal of her ideas by Sophia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, we had Mark. His mind was a well-oiled machine when it came to data migration. With years of successful projects under his belt, he had an innate knack of making intricate look effortless. He often voluntarily took the reins of task delegation, a quality that artistic Sophia and punctual Allison appreciated. Yet, he and Allison had hit a bump during their previous project, sparking a small shipwreck in their cordial camaraderie.\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned my gaze to Sophia now, who sat with an air of aloof sophistication. Sophia was the creative mind, her ideas fresh and sparkling. Yet, her disdain for punctuality was a nightmare. She often crumbled under the weight of multiple tasks. Besides, data migration was like Greek to her. She was often dependent on Mark for his technical advice which she duly regarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the past project saw a dip in productivity when this trio was grouped together. Allison still had some lingering resentments towards Sophia, a fallout from many dismissed suggestions, and also maintained an uneasy silence with Mark after an unresolved coding dispute. Sophia was feeling overwhelmed. Mark was trying his best to hold the fort together.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such a situation at hand, I had to play my cards astutely. A daunting task of data migration and project coordination had to be done while mending fences and motivating the team. With the team’s history, delegating responsibilities was as tactful as diffusing a time-bomb. The past always shadows the present, and in this case, required intricate handling to light the path for the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked over the room one last time, rehearsing my speech, ready to guide this talented trio towards our objective, hoping that I could heal wounds and blur resentments in the process. My fingers drummed on the table. Code had to be written. Data had to migrate. Projects had to be coordinated. The sun was still shining outside. The day was still young. And on the horizon was a sea of possibilities.\n",
      "\n",

      "Let's solve this by thinking step-by-step. First, we will figure out each person's skill level for each task. Then, we can measure how well they all work together in pairs. From this, we can find the most efficient assignment that maximizes the scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with Allison. Allison rocks and is good at data migration (due to her coding abilities) and probably project coordination (due to her punctuality). So, let's assume her skill level is 3 out of 3 for both tasks. Her relationship with Sophia, however, is not great because someones idea was dismissed therefore we should rate it a 1. Her relationship with Mark isn't that much better due to an argument over some coding so we will give this a score of 1 as well.  (She works better alone)\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to Mark. Mark is described as really good at data migration (3) and task delegation (3) as he has had a lot of experience \"taking the reins\".  Sophia and Mark seem to get along, maybe not great, but well enough (2). \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Sophia. Sophia is bad at both data migration (1) as it's described as \"Greek\" to her, she's also bad at delegation because she doesn't like punctuality and gets overwhelmed (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's assign these values to the options and take the one with the highest sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "( A ) Data Migration: Allison (3) + Project Coordination: Mark (3) and Sophia (1) + Relationship(Mark, Sophia) (2) = 9\n",

      "( C ) Data Migration: Mark (3) + Project Coordination: Allison (3) and Sophia (1) + Relationship(Allison, Sophia) (1) = 8\n",

      "Amidst the vibrant chaos of the Redwood Zoo, nestled in the heart of the city's sprawling jungle, the task of assigning roles was a crucial cog in the machinery of its operation.

      "\n",
      "Let's begin with Alex, the tall lad with bright eyes, whose history with the mighty beast of the animal kingdom, lacked a certain comfort. The lad, known to express an almost innate unease around animals larger than him, fell short of the prerequisites for an Animal Caretaker. His comfort zone extended to the four-legged companions in our homes, a sentiment I withheld from the petting zoo section of our park. Yet, his association and collaboration with Mia had seen quite the successes in their high school club's fundraising initiatives.\n",

Unresolved perhaps, but a factor nonetheless.\n",

However, her overly thorough methods would invariably result in clashes with Olivia, who criticized her for crossing some form of unspoken boundary.\n",

      "Petra, the dedicated housewife, felt a thrill at the thought of her surprise anniversary dinner for her husband, Daniel. She had been skillfully maneuvering around Daniel's eagerness to pitch in without disappointing him or giving up her surprise. \n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel, ever-the-observant-husband, noted Petra's unusual enthusiasm about the day's menu. Despite not knowing the details, he appreciated her effort and wanted to help—silently, he decided to deploy his best skill—patiently awaiting his moment to help, maybe when Petra asked for something from the pantry. Amidst the excitement, there was Clara, their maid—ever diligent and efficient, trying to keep the surroundings perfect for this special evening. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tucked away, under the counter, was Petra's secret recipe book, her culinary treasure. Her solace in confusing times, her secret weapon during their flavorful adventures. While toward the back of the pantry, was the glass jar of Petra's favorite spice blends—something that Daniel was well aware of, in case an opportunity arose for him to assist or distract when Petra might need it. \n",
      "\n",
      "All three residents of the home were aware of each item's location. The secret recipe book under the counter, the glass jar in the pantry, and the anxious excitement that filled the air—a fragrance even more intoxicating than the delicious smells that would soon fill the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "With tact and secrecy, Petra relocated her cherished recipe book from its hidden spot under the counter to its temporary home on the kitchen table. The pages were swiftly opened to reveal her secret recipes which she was eager to start preparing for the long-awaited anniversary surprise. While Petra was engrossed in her preparations, Clara continued her sweeping routine in the kitchen. Clara's steady broom strokes on the wooden floor echoed a little in the otherwise busy and humming kitchen. In the background, beyond the kitchen door, Daniel could be seen in the dining room, meticulously setting the table for the anticipated special dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The placement of the rooms allowed Clara to easily notice Petra's movements in her peripheral vision while she was executing her chores. Every move Petra made was observed in Clara's line of sight. Simultaneously, separated by the walls, Daniel was diligently arranging the tableware in the dining room which was separate from Petra's bustling kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hoping to spruce up the setting, Daniel delicately relocated a glass jar filled with decorative pebbles to the center of the dining table. His subtle contribution for the evening - a perfectly presentable table for their special anniversary dinner. Amidst the flurry of the special day's preparations, Clara diligently carried on with her duties in the upstairs bathroom, unseen from the dining room. Meanwhile, Petra was wholly engrossed in the allure of a new recipe in her cherished, hidden book which lay opened on the kitchen island, away from prying eyes of the dining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of her usual tidying, Clara spotted Petra's treasured recipe book on the kitchen table. Ensuring it stayed clandestine, Clara carefully transferred it back to its usual hideaway spot beneath the counter. In the midst of the anniversary excitement, Clara deftly transferred Petra's secret weapon back to its hiding place when Daniel stepped out into the garage to retrieve extra utensils. Performing her duty with a sense of urgency, she made sure to move quietly to not disturb Petra, who was engrossed in the process of boiling a massive pot of pasta water on the stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the commotion and fervor in the kitchen, the hubbub did not stretch as far as the garage, which remained undisturbed by the domestic activity occurring in the main part of the house. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Petra was oblivious to Clara's subtle maneuver while she busied herself at the stove, focussed on making sure the large pot of water reached the perfect boil.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the careful orchestration of duties by each individual within the house concluded in a harmonious anniversary celebration. The marks of a successful evening consisted of a delectable meal, a serene atmosphere, and the memory of a smooth, incident-free evening where everyone played their role to perfection.\n",

      "\n",
      "Throughout the story, the glass jar only moves once to the dining table. However, while Daniel was moving the glass jar, Clara was upstairs in the restroom carrying out her duties. It's highly unlikely that she saw Daniel move the glass jar, so we can assume that she still believes it to be in the pantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clara does go to the kitchen in the story and moves a recipe book from the kitchen table, but because it's the kitchen table and not the dining room table, we can assume she hasn't seen the glass jar there.\n",

      "Deep in the woods, ensconced in his humble cabin, lived Neil, a seasoned survivalist enjoying the simplicity of his isolated lifestyle. His friend Bruce was present, awed by Neil's environment and eager to join him in his exploration of the wilderness. On her usual patterns, Jenny, the local ranger, had also come by, her vigilant and caring nature leading her to check on Neil's welfare periodically. \n",
      "\n",
      "The cabin served as more than just a dwelling place. It held Neil's prized emergency beacon, a testament to his caution and respect for the unpredictability of nature. Bruce admired this beacon, a tangible reminder that, in such a place, one was always a twist of fate away from a dire situation. Neil and Jenny, aware of its significance, never misplaced the knowledge of its location at the cabin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also present within the cabin was a meticulously detailed map of the surrounding area, essential not just for exploration but also for survival. Bruce's eyes danced across the contours marked on the map, a geography lesson waiting to unfold. Jenny too, accustomed to similar maps in her line of work, took note of its position at the cabin. The one memorial fact, acknowledged by all, was the location of the emergency beacon and map in Neil's humble cabin. They each knew where to find the tools essential for survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underneath the steady gaze of Bruce and Jenny, Neil moved his emergency beacon securely into his backpack for his upcoming forage mission, its presence providing him a comforting safety net against the mysterious of the woods. Involved in their respective tasks, Neil, Bruce and Jenny silently continued the day's progress. Bruce lent his able hands to Neil, aiding him in preparing for the impending journey ahead. His location allowed him an almost strategic advantage, standing close as Neil methodically packed his gear for the forage. Their diligent teamwork was a sight to behold. A dance of survival, punctuated by the rhythm of their shared respect for the wilderness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not too far away, Jenny was herself engaged in a separate conversation. Her companion in this dialogue was another local ranger named Mark.  His usual station was at the park's entrance - a stern sentinel against the backdrop of Mother Nature. Their talk unfolding even as the missions of survival and exploration took hold within the forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smirk of anticipation danced on Bruce's face as he clenched the area's map firmly relocating it to the porch. Fresh wilderness sprawling around him beckoned for an adventure he was more than ready to embark on. Amidst the quiet rustle of forest life, with Jenny engaging Mark in discussion about local wildlife, Bruce seized the moment to interact with the map, beyond the awareness of his friend Neil, who was busy ensuring his living space was clean post-dinner. Bruce, enamoured by the sprawling freedom that lied ahead, stealthily moved the item as Neil busied himself inside. The open wilderness beckoning his adventurous spirit, he carefully located it to the porch, the delicious anticipation plastered visibly across his features. All the while, his actions were quietly observed by Jenny from a distance, as her ranger's instinct always kept her vigilant.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long day in the wild, his trusty emergency beacon swinging from his belt, Neil stepped into his cabin. Gently, with the protective precision of a seasoned survivalist, Neil placed the emergency beacon back in its usual spot, ensuring it was within arm's reach in case of any unexpected emergencies. As Neil situated himself back into the comfort of his cabin, Bruce was engrossed in a local flora guidebook. His keen gaze analysing diagrams and pictures as he fostered a newfound appreciation for the raw beauty and complexity found in the simplest of plants. He was so enthralled by the intricate details that he was unaware of Neil's condoled activities, his thoughts instead dwelling on how he could further explore the wilderness he found himself in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Jenny was keeping her ever-watchful gaze on Neil's living area from the ranger tower. Her job demanded caution, and she took this duty seriously, carrying it even into the care she bestowed on those living in solitude in the area, like Neil. Even at a distance, with the magnified view the tower's vantage point offered, she had a clear line of sight to check on Neil's safe return and to oversee his direct environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Neil's solitary life in the wild continued, with or without the understanding eyes of his friends-- not simply an existence, but a harmony with the wilderness. His experience and structured order, as well as the company of Bruce and Jenny, makes the wilderness a new home, a common ground for them all to learn from, and each other. The tower stood tall, Bruce examined the guidebook, and in between, the cabin stayed still; a haven in the wilderness, teeming with silent stories of survival, exploration, and eternal friendship. The forest sighed around them as another day came to a close. In the quiet, an odd peace settled between man and wilderness, showing that two very different worlds can intertwine into something strangely beautiful.\n",

      "In the heart of a busy garage, Oliver worked attentively on a challenging repair project, surrounded by sounds and smells that were second nature to him. His role as mechanic required precision and order that he found subtly comforting. Max, always paying attention to the concerns of safety and cleanliness, keenly observed the garage layout from his supervisory standpoint, believing firmly in the advantages of an orderly and clean workspace. A new addition to the team, a young apprentice Grace, stood wide-eyed, soaking up the industrial symphony that played around her. She eagerly sought to learn about the arsenal of tools and their specific roles in an auto repair, her curiosity hard to contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tools, each with its purpose and placement, seemed to be an extension of the mechanics themselves. The wrench, vital in Oliver's hands, was lying on top of the repair project, quietly serving its part in fixing a stubborn bolt. A stray screwdriver lay on the floor, away from its usual station, but not unnoticed. Everyone in the garage was aware of their locations, forming a tacit understanding. Each tool had its place, and every mechanic had their dance with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the bolt now firmly tightened, Oliver carefully placed the wrench back into its designated spot within his cherished toolkit. His intense focus momentarily releasing with a sigh of accomplishment as he checked off another successful task from his day's work. Simultaneously, Grace was studying Oliver's precise movements with intense curiosity, each of his simple yet refined actions unraveling layers of experience that she was seeking to comprehend. She could see how Oliver's well-organized toolkit played a crucial part in his efficient execution of tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off to one corner, Max unblinkingly kept an eye on Oliver's work progress, deeply appreciating the experienced mechanic's efficiency and organization skills. Yet, his gaze was not solely fixated on Oliver. As the garage's superintendent, he dutifully conducted routine safety checks in between his bouts of observation, the fussy cleanliness and orderly state of workspace truly reiterated his mantra of safe and timely vehicle repairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Oliver continued to work in a rhythm that seemed akin to a choreographed dance, each tool being swung, twisted, or turned with a specific purpose in hand, under Grace's fascinated gaze. Max ran his experienced eyes over every inch of the garage, his stern exterior not mellowing down even by a fraction, the distinctive clanging of tools on metal slicing through the thick garage air.\n",

      "As soon as Max spotted the lone screwdriver on the floor, he did not hesitate to stoop down, pick it up and neatly place it back into Oliver's well-organized toolkit. This small act, reinforcing the importance of cleanliness and order in the bustling garage, subtly reminded the team of the overall efficiency and safety that came with such organization. Amidst all of this, Grace was hoofing it towards the far end of the garage to fetch a new oil filter nestled within the many shelves of the storage room. As she traipsed through the lengthy space, bustling with automotive duties, the faint yet persistent hum of the garage tie was a constant reminder of the work that still lay ahead of her apprenticeship. Meanwhile, Oliver was engrossed in diagnosing a stubborn mechanical fault of an SUV, determined to use his skills to set the vehicle on the road once again. Max, ever vigilant, could be seen shuffling around the garage, zeroing in on the smallest irregularities and tirelessly restoring the workspace to its immaculate self.\n",
      "\n",
      "With much anticipation, Grace picked up the wrench and moved it over to the repair project. She was ready to take the next leap in her apprenticeship under the watchful eyes of Oliver and Max. As the hum of activity continued, a moment of quiet learning was taking place. Oliver's voice, steady and informative, cut through the mechanical symphony as he explained the subtleties of brake pad replacement to Grace. Her unwavering attention was heightened by the item she had picked up, fiddling with it as she absorbed the lesson. With Max engaging Grace in a discussion about safety precautions, the two seasoned mechanics were passing down not just their practical prowess but a deep respect for the industry's unwritten rules. Simultaneously, Grace was positioned directly beside Oliver, observing every twist and turn of his proficient maneuvers. Her eyes flicked between the tool in her hand to the task at hand, eager to take the leap from observer to active participant in the orchestra of metal and muscle that was ever at play in the bustling garage.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the daylight waned and the workday neared its end, the undercurrent of collaborative learning amongst Grace, Oliver, and Max was a testament to the spirit of the garage - a place where knowledge was freely shared, skills were honed, and a well-oiled engine was a shared victory. Through the grease, the grind, and the occasional rough day, the team had proven their mettle. They were not just workers in a garage, but artists in their own right, each making their unique mark in the world one car repair at a time.\n",

      "Based on this story, we want to identify where someone believes that a certain object is at the end of the story. In order to do that, you need to read the story and keep track of where they think the object is at each point. When an object is moved, the person may observe its new location if they saw it move.\n",

      "Then, Oliver moved the wrench to the toolkit (so he still knows where it's at)\n",
