    "One day Max says to Liz, \"Out of the 25 people taking either English or French, you and I are the only two taking both.'' Liz, being mathematically inclined, responds by pointing out that there are exactly twice as many people in the English class as there are in the French class. How many people are taking English but not French?",
    "Let's think step by step\nLet $x$ be the number of kids in the French class not including Max and Liz and let $y$ be the number of kids in the English class not including Max and Liz. Since all 25 kids are either just in English, just in French, or in both (Max and Liz), we know that $x+y+2=25$ or $x+y=23$. Furthermore, we know that $2(x+2)=y+2$ since $x+2$ and $y+2$ represent the total number of kids in each of the two classes.  Rewriting the last equation gives us $2x+2=y$ which can be substituted into the first equation to give us $x+(2x+2)=23$, which gives $x=7$. Substituting this value into any of the equations gives us $y=\\boxed{16}$.\nThe answer is 16"

    "In how many ways can a president and a 2-person committee be chosen from a group of 8 people (where the order in which we choose the 2 people doesn't matter)?  (The president cannot be on the committee.)",
    "Let's think step by step\nWe have to first choose a president, and then we have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter. So first there are 8 ways to choose the president. Then there are 7 ways to choose the first person, and 6 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $7 \\times 6$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $8\\times(7 \\times 6)/2 = \\boxed{168}$ ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee from 8 people.\nThe answer is 168"

    "How many $y$-intercepts does the graph of the parabola $x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7$ have?",
    "Let's think step by step\nA $y$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $y$-axis, so $x = 0$.  Hence, the number of $y$-intercepts corresponds to the number of real solutions of the quadratic equation $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $(-3)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = -47$, which is negative, so the quadratic has no real roots.  Therefore, the number of $y$-intercepts is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nreal ticklen=3;\nreal tickspace=2;\n\nreal ticklength=0.1cm;\nreal axisarrowsize=0.14cm;\npen axispen=black+1.3bp;\nreal vectorarrowsize=0.2cm;\nreal tickdown=-0.5;\nreal tickdownlength=-0.15inch;\nreal tickdownbase=0.3;\nreal wholetickdown=tickdown;\nvoid rr_cartesian_axes(real xleft, real xright, real ybottom, real ytop, real xstep=1, real ystep=1, bool\n\nuseticks=false, bool complexplane=false, bool usegrid=true) {\n\nimport graph;\n\nreal i;\n\nif(complexplane) {\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Re}$\",(xright,0),SE);\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Im}$\",(0,ytop),NW);\n\n} else {\n\nlabel(\"$x$\",(xright+0.4,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"$y$\",(-0.5,ytop+0.2));\n\n}\n\nylimits(ybottom,ytop);\n\nxlimits( xleft, xright);\n\nreal[] TicksArrx,TicksArry;\n\nfor(i=xleft+xstep; i<xright; i+=xstep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArrx.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=ybottom+ystep; i<ytop; i+=ystep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArry.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif(usegrid) {\n\nxaxis(BottomTop(extend=false), Ticks(\"%\", TicksArrx ,pTick=gray\n\n(0.22),extend=true),p=invisible);//,above=true);\n\nyaxis(LeftRight(extend=false),Ticks(\"%\", TicksArry ,pTick=gray(0.22),extend=true),\n\np=invisible);//,Arrows);\n\n}\n\nif(useticks) {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArry ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArrx ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n} else {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n}\n};\nreal lowerx, upperx, lowery, uppery;\nreal f(real x) {return 2*x^2 - 3*x + 7;}\nlowery = -1;\nuppery = 3;\nrr_cartesian_axes(-2,15,lowery,uppery);\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*(graph(f,lowery,uppery,operator ..)), red);\n[/asy]\nThe answer is 0"
